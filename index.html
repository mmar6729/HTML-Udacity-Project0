<h1>Learning to program with Udacity</h1>

<p>Starting out in any creative endeavour requires dedication, perseverance and 
an active and engaging community of like minded souls. This especially so when
learning to program. </p>

This is a short summary of what I have learned so far ferom starting this course as well
as the content introduced in Lesson 1.

<h3><u>What is required to adopt the mindset of a developer?</u></h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Procedural Thinking</b></li>
  <p><ol>
  Having clear and anambigious instructions, such as a cooking recipe 
  for example.
  </ol></p>
  
  <li><b>Abstract Thinking</b></li>
  <p><ol>Find patterns in thinks to find similarities and patterns that on first 
  glance may not be evident. 
  </ol></p>
  
  <li><b>Systems Thinking</b></li>
  <p><ol>Breaking big concepts into manageable chunks. Would you be able to build a 
    space station withought first thinking about the different layers that make up
    such a project? System thinking is the idea of taking one massive idea and 
    breaking it down to its component parts. 
  </ol></p>
  
  <li><b>Technological Empathy</b></li>
  <p><ol>This does not mean working out how your computer is feeling and engaging Dr Phil.
  No! It is understanding how technolgoy works, and predicting behaviour. if you type
  www.goggles.com this is not going to take you to your favourite search engine. So cultivating
  an affinity with technology and finding out how things work will help develop your 
  <em><b>TechEmp.</b></em>
  </ol></p>
</ul>

<h3><u>Summary of Lesson 1</u></h3>

  <P><b>What is HTML</b></P>
  
  <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage, which is one 
  of the core technolgies for building web pages that enable information to be displayed
  in a web browser.
  
  <p>HTML describes the structure of pages using what is known as markup, that are 
  composed of elements such as 'paragraph elements': <b><xmp><p></p></xmp></b> 
  
  or various other elements that define how a page will be formated, to create a list, or a table
  or even an element to add styling, such as bolding for example. <br><br>
  
  See The World Wide Web Consortium <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss">(W3C)</a> 
  for further info. 
  <b><xmp><b></b></xmp></b>
 </p>
  
  <p><b>Basic HTML structure of a webpage</b></p>
  
  <xmp>
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <title>This a appears on the browser's tab'</title>
</head>
  <body>
  Main content of your webpage
  </body>
</html>
</xmp>

<p><b>HTML Vocabulary</b></p>
<!--I looked at the following website for instructions on how to
add styling to the list element: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp-->

<ul style="list-font:bold-style-type:circle">
  <li><b>Tag:</b> <br><br>
  <ul>An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have 
  an opening tag: <xmp><p> for example and a closing tag, </p></xmp> Some tags (called "void" tags) 
  do not require a closing tag like the following tag, that enables you to move your content to the
  next line:
  <xmp> The break tag - <br> - for example</xmp> 
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Element:</b><br><br>
  <ul>  
    An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</ul>
  </li><br>
  
  <li><b>Attribute:</b></li><br>
  <ul>
    This is a property of an HTML element, the attributes define what can be down to further,
    enhance the content within the element structure. For example, to set the href attribute of an
anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write:
<xmp><a href="www.udacity.com"></xmp>
  </ul>
</ul>
</body>
</HTML>
